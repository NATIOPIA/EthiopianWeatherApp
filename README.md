✅ **Optional Decorative Touches**:
- Add emojis (🌿, ☀️, 🌧️, 🍃) in tips and headings.  
- Add your **screenshot** of the app in the repo (`screenshot.png`) to make the README lively.  
- You can also bold headings for better readability.

If you want, I can **also make a fully styled README with color badges, GitHub stats, and fancy sections** like “Built With” and “Future Features” so it looks professional on your GitHub page.  

Do you want me to do that next?
